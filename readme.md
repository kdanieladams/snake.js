# Snake.js
### by K. Daniel Adams

Simple take on Snake, in ES5.  Use the arrow keys or AWSD to move the snake.  Resets if you hit the wall or eat yourself.  Loosely based on <a href="https://pastebin.com/Z3zhb7cY" target="_blank">this hacky example from Chris DeLeon</a>.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo 
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:kdanieladams/snake.js.git
    ```
2. Run the `index.html` file in a browser.
    ```
    cd ./snake.js/
    open index.html
    ```

It's *just* that easy! Don't you just love ES5?
